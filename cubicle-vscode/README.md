# Cubicle VS Code Extension

We recommend using the cubicle-vscode extension for verification support.

## Installation

The Cubicle VS Code Extension extension is available on the VS Code marketplace. Simply search for `bbentzen.cubicle-vscode` on the VS Code Extensions view and click on the Install buttom. Alternativelly, you can install the extension manually from source. To do this, assuming you have already cloned the cubicle repository, you can run:

```
$ cd cubicle-vscode
$ npm install
$ npm run compile
```

Now you can copy the folder to `~/.vscode/extensions`.


## Usage

You need a cubicle executable. Open any `.cube` file on VS Code. Once you see any highlighted code you can compile the file simply by saving it with `Ctrl+S`.

If you see a message "Cubicle binary cannot be located", this is most likely because you need to tell VS Code the exact path to your executable to compile the file. You need to open the Settings editor via File > Preferences > Settings menu or using the `Ctrl+,` shortcut, then and go to Extensions > Cubicle Configuration. Under Cubicle: Executable Path you should provide the full path of the executable on your computer. For example:

`/home/myusername/cubicle/_build/default/bin/main.exe`
