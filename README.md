# Cubicle

Cubicle is an experimental proof assistant based on a one-dimensional cubical type theory developed by Jon Sterling, Carlo Angiuli, and Daniel Gratzer <a id="1">[1]</a><a id="1">[2]</a>. Its name is a pun based on the fact that the system only deals with a small space partitioned off within a larger spaces studied in univalent foundations. To be precise, Cubicle runs on a cubical reconstruction of extensional type theory that enjoys a judgmental version of the unicity of identity proofs principle (UIP), meaning that any two elements of the same path type are the same up to judgmental identity. 

## Installation

To install and use Cubicle, you need OCaml version 4.14.2 or greater. We also recommend relying on the [opam](https://opam.ocaml.org/) package manager for installation. You will also need [menhir](https://opam.ocaml.org/packages/menhir/) for the LR(1) parser generator, and [dune](https://github.com/ocaml/dune) for building the project. Both can be installed using opam. It is best to ensure that your opam is up-to-date before installing the dependencies:

```
$ opam update && opam upgrade
$ opam install menhir dune
```

Next, clone the repository and build the project using dune:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/bbentzen/cubicle.git
$ cd cubicle
$ dune build
```

This will create the executable `main.exe` which you can run on any `.cube` file to typecheck its contents with Cubicle. Since this compiled executable is typically be found under a subfolder such as `_build/default/bin`, you can run it as follows:

```
$ dune exec _build/default/bin/main.exe <filename>.cube
```

However, we recommend using the cubicle-vscode extension for verification support. More information can be found at [cubicle-vscode/README.md](https://github.com/bbentzen/cubicle/blob/master/cubicle-vscode/README.md).

## Usage
